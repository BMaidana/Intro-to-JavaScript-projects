      <h2>Project Steps</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Open this file in your browser and your text editor.</li>
        <li>Add your name, section, and email to the HTML.</li>
        <li>Based on the problem statement below, complete the Planning List. The Checklist has been done for you.</li>
        <li>Locate the <code class="language-js">part03()</code> function in the <code>project-part03.js</code> file and write the code to complete this project part.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>Write a program that prompts for the names of two (2) flowers and stores them. The program then displays the entered names from storage with descriptive labels. The names are then swapped in their storage locations, the first name is put in the second one&rsquo;s storage and the second name is put in the first one&rsquo;s storage. The names are then displayed again from storage with labels.</p>
      <h3>Restrictions</h3>
      <p><strong>No more than three variables are allowed for this part.</strong> You must output the two variables in the same order for the &ldquo;Strings as entered&rdquo; output and the &ldquo;Switched strings&rdquo; section. You can&rsquo;t just output each variable in reverse order. You actually need to swap the data from one variable into the other.</p>
      <h3>Hint</h3>
      <p>Imagine two glasses of liquids, one blue, one green. The task is to interchange the liquids from the two glasses. Obviously, to accomplish this, the liquid currently in one of the glasses, say Glass #1, has to have its contents set aside into a third glass. Then, the contents of Glass #2 can be poured into Glass #1. At that point, now Glass #2 is empty, and can have the contents of the third glass poured into it (Glass #2). Thus, the contents of the two glasses are interchanged. With variables in a programming language, the same kind of thing must be done for this Project Part 3. The &ldquo;move&rdquo; between two variables is accomplished via the assign operator (=). And the third temp variable is needed so that the content of the first variable can be safely stored outside of itself, so that when the content of the second variable is moved into the first variable (thus erasing its previous content), that content remains available to be moved into the second variable.</p>
